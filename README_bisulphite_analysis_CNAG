This describes the WGBS-Seq analysis performed for the Blueprint project

Mapping
-------

The mapping was carried out using GEM 3.0 in bisulfite mapping mode 
to a converted reference sequence:
GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna, which can be found at
the URL:

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz

The reference file contains two copies of the hsapiens GRCh38
reference, one with all C's changes to T's and one with all G's
changed to A's. In addition the file also contains two copies of the
NCBI viral genome dataset (rel 69,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesHome.cgi?taxid=10239),
modified in the same way as for the human genome.  For the viral
contigs the names have been shortened to the accession# only. Before
mapping, the original sequence in the input FASTQ was stored (by
appending to the sequence ID line).  The sequence data was then
modified so that any C's in the first read of a pair were converted to
T's, and any G's on the second read of a pair were converted to A's.
The mapping was then performed, and the original sequence was replaced
in the output mapping.  

Command line used: 

gem3-mapper -p --bisulfite-mode -I GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set_BS.gem -s 1 -p -M 4

The SAM output produced by the gem3 mapper contains a custom tag, XB,
that denotes the version of the reference to which the read is mapped
(either CT or GA).  Read pairs were selected using the default
read-pairing algorithm in gem3, and where the assigned MAPQ score for
the read pair was >=20.

Methylation and genotype calling
--------------------------------

Calling of methylation levels and genotypes was performed by the
program bs_call version 2.0 in paired end mode and trimming the first and
last 5 bases from each read pair by using the following command line:

bs_call -r GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set_vir.fna.gz -p -L5

Filtering
---------
Filtering of CpG sites and homozygous cytosines was
performed on the VCF output of bs_call using the program filter_vcf
with default parameters.

vcf_filter sample.vcf

This generate one file per sample with all observed sites where the reference
or the called genotype indicates the possible presence of a C followed
by a G.  No other filtering is performed.

col 1: Chromosome
col 2: Position of first base in dinucleotide (C) (offset 1)
col 3: Reference bases at the two positions
col 4: Called genotypes at the two positions (iupac codes used for heterozygous calls)
col 5: Phred scaled probability of genotype *not* being as in col 4
col 6: Methylation probability (combined estimate from the weighted average of the MLEs at the two positions)
col 7: Standard deviation of methylation probability (from weighted average)
col 8: No. of non-converted C reads (sum of counts at both positions)
col 9: No. of converted C reads (idem)
col 10: Total reads supporting genotype call (idem)
col 11: Total reads (idem)
col 12: 8 comma separated numbers with allele counts: (A,C,G,T) not
informative for methylation and (A,C,G,T) informative for methylation
from forward strand
col 13: idem from reverse strand

BigWig files
------------

Wig files were produced from the CpG files above by filtering on
sites with homozgous CG genotype call (col 4) and phred score >=20.
One file with the methylation estimate and another with the standard
error of the methylation estimate were produced per sample using the
perl script mk_wig.pl.  wigToBigWig was then used to convert the wig
files to BigWig format.

Hyper/Hypo methylated regions
-------------------------------------------

Hypomethylated regions have an average methylation of <0.25 and all
CpGs in the regions have methylation <0.5.

Hypermethylated regions have an average methylation of >0.75 and all
CpGs in the regions have methylation >0.5.

CpG sites have been filtered to have a maximum total read count of 500.

Columns:

col1: Chromosome
col2: Region start position
col3: Region end position
col4: Size of region in base pairs
col5: Average methylation level in region
col6: Number of CpGs in region
col7: Median number of non-converted reads at CpGs in region
col8: Median number of converted reads at CpGs in region
col9: Median number of total reads at CpGs in region
col10: Island/Shelf/Shore (union of CpG Island annotations for all CpGs in region)
col11: refGene annotation (union of refGene  annotations for all CpGs in region)

Annotations:

Single '.' means no annotation available

gencode annotation:

Comma separated list of annotations.  Each annotation is either '.'
(no annotation) or has the following semicolon separated fields:

transcript_id
transcript_name
transcript_type
transcript_status
gene_id
gene_name
gene_type
gene_status
strand
annotation_type
coding/non_coding flag
